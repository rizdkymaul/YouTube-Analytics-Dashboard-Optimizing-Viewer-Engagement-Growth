# YouTube-Analytics-Dashboard-Optimizing-Viewer-Engagement-Growth

From the dataset provided by Google, we can use a Customer Journey approach because the YouTube platform heavily relies on how the audience discovers, interacts with, and returns to the channel. With this approach, we can analyze data based on the phases of the user journey, namely:

`1. Awareness → How the audience discovers the channel?`

`2. Engagement → How actively the audience interacts with the content?`

`3. Conversion → Whether the audience takes further action?`

`4. Retention → How many return and become loyal to the channel?`
